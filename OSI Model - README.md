# What is OSI Model.

The OSI model is a conceptual framework that explains how data moves from one device to another over a network using seven logical layers, from physical transmission (cables, signals) upto user-facing application (like browsers or email clients). It is defined by ISO (International Standard Organization) to standardize how different devices communicate over networks. Each layer has a specific role and interacts only with the layer directly above or below it, which make complex networking easier to understand and design.
