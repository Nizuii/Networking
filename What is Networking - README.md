# What is a Network:

- A **network** is simply a **collection of interconnected devices that can communicate - sending and recieving data, and also sharing resources with eachother.**
- Importance of Network:

  - **Resource Sharing**: Multiple devices can share hardware and software resources.
  - **Communication**: Instant messaging, emails, and video calls rely on networks.
  - **Data Access**: Access files and databases from any connected device.
  - **Collaboration**: Work together in real-time, even when miles apart.
 
## Types of Networks:

Networks varies in size and scopes. Primarily there are 2 types of networks:

1. **Local Area Networks** (LAN)
1. **Wide Area Networks** (WAN)

### 1. Local Area Network (LAN)

- **Local Area Networks** (LAN) connects devices over a short distance, Such as within Home, Small office, Schools etc...
- Key charactersitics of LAN:

  - **Geographical Scope**: Covers a small area.
  - **Ownership**: Typically owned or managed by a single person or organization.
  - **Speed**: High data transfer rates.
  - **Media**: Uses wired (ethernet cables) or wireless (WiFi) connections.

### 2. Wide Area Network (WAN):

- **Wide Area Networks** (WAN) spans a large geographical area, connecting multiple **LAN**'s
- Key charactersitics of WAN:

  - **Geographical Scope**: Covers cities, countries or continents.
  - **Ownership**: Often a collective or distributed ownership (e.g., internet service providers).
  - **Speed**: Slower data transfer rates compared to LANs due to long-distance data travel.
  - **Media**: Utilizes fiber optics, satellite links, and leased telecommunication lines.
