# What are Network Logs ?

- Network Logs are detailed records of what's happening across a network. Think of them as the black box of a network. Every connection, request, error and suspicious action leaves a trail here.
- They are automatically generated by network devices and softwares like:

  - Routers & Switches
  - Firewalls
  - Servers
  - IDS/IPS systems
  - Proxies & VPN's
 
## What do network logs actually

- Source IP & Destination IP
- Ports & Protocols
- Timestamps
- Actions Taken
- User or device identity
- Error messages or alerts

Example (Simplified):
```bash
2025-01-12 14:22:10 | SRC: 192.168.1.5 | DST: 8.8.8.8 | PORT: 443 | ALLOWED
```
## Why network logs are important?

Network Logs Helps us:

- 🔍 **Detect Hacking Attempts.**:

  - Reveals Repeated Failed Logins: Brute Force Attacks.
  - Port Scanning Behavior: Attacker mapping your system.
  - Suspicious IP locations: access from unexpected countries.
  - Traffic spikes: DDOS or Bot activity.
  - Strange Payloads: SQL injection, XSS attempts.

- **🚨 Investigate Incidents.**:

  - 🕒 Timeline: When the attack started and ended.
  - 👤 Entry point: Compromised account, open port, vulnerability.
  - 🔓 Actions taken: Files accessed, commands run.
  - 📤 Data movement: Was data exfiltrated.

- **📊 Monitor Performance.**:

  Not all problems are attacks. Some are performance bottlenecks - logs expose them.
  Logs shows:
  
  - Slow response times.
  - Packet drops
  - Bandwidth saturation.
  - Repeated retries or failures
  - Service crashes.

- 🛡️ Prove compliance

Logs provide:

- Audit trails (Who accessed what, when, why)
- Proof of access control enforcement.
- Evidence of monitoring and response.
- Forensic Integrity
