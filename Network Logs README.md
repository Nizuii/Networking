# What are Network Logs ?

- Network Logs are detailed records of what's happening across a network. Think of them as the black box of a network. Every connection, request, error and suspicious action leaves a trail here.
- They are automatically generated by network devices and softwares like:

  - Routers & Switches
  - Firewalls
  - Servers
  - IDS/IPS systems
  - Proxies & VPN's
 
## What do network logs actually

- Source IP & Destination IP
- Ports & Protocols
- Timestamps
- Actions Taken
- User or device identity
- Error messages or alerts

Example (Simplified):
```bash
2025-01-12 14:22:10 | SRC: 192.168.1.5 | DST: 8.8.8.8 | PORT: 443 | ALLOWED
```
