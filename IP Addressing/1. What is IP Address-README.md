# What is IP Address?

- IP Address is a layer 3 logical address assigned by an administrator. Unlike MAC addresses which are hard coded or built into NIC by the manufacturer. An IP address is configured by an administrator.
- An IP address may change within the subnet, for example: When using DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).
- An IP address resides at the layer 3 of the OSI model.
- Ip address is used to uniquely identify a device on a network. It is used by the router to determine where that device is.
- Every device on the internet has a unique IP address.
