# What is DNS?

- **DNS (Domain Name System)** is a phone book of the internet. It translates the domain name's of the web page (eg: www.google.com) to its IP address (eg: 142.251.43.36).
- A **Domain Name** is a readable address like **www.example.com** that people can easily remember. An **IP address** is a numerical label like **93.184.216.34**.
- DNS bridges the gap between these two, so we can just type www.google.com without needing to remember the underlying IP address.

## DNS Hierarchy

- DNS is organized like a tree, starting from the root and branching out into different layers.
